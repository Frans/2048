# 2048 Quaggans
This will be a modifcation of the 2048, enhanced by the cuteness of the Quaggan's from ArenaNets Guild Wars 2.




The 2048 this is based on is 'A small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)

The official app can also be found on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabrielecirulli.app2048) and [App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805)'.

## Donations
I made this in my spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying me coffee, you can donate at my BTC address: `19m8spXe8xwA2iNVvzPbm91vu95MvPHmWa`. Thank you very much!
